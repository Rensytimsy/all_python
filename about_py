Python is a high level programming language that was developed by guiddo van rossum
Python language is a extensible customisable application.
    NB: In python while declaring identifiers it's not a must to state the data type , the python interpreter automatically 
    knows the data type.

VARIABLES AND DATATYPES

    A variable is a named memory location that stores the reference to an object in the memory location
    A variable is also known as an identifier.

    Why variables are said to be objects in python??...

            RULES IDENTIFIERS FOLLOW

        Should start with a letter or underscore but not a digit/number
        Should not have a name like for keyword e.g del
        Can contain letters and digits 
        Can be of any length

VALUES
    values are basically what programs work with
    Also known as literals
    A literal can be of any type ,example int, float and string

OBJECTS AND CLASSES:
#A class is an object constructor.
#Simply to create a class one uses the class keyword.
#Using the class name you can come up with different objects.

class myObj:
    x = 20
    y = 10
    randName = "Timothy Mutwiri"
    age = 20

#using the class myObj we can create an object named newObj with that class name
newObj = myObj()
#print(newObj.age)

#The best way to craete an object is the process below since it can contain different values.

class person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
       self.name = name
       self.age = age

people = person("Timothy", 20)
print(people.name)
